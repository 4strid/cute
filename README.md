Framework for composing applications and games with Canvas

## build and run

it should suffice to run
```
npm install
```

then
```
npm run develop
```

Once compiled, open index.html in a web browser to view Squares App, the prototypal app used
to define the interface of the framework.

The source code for the application is found in /src. I put in some comments so you can kind
of see how it works.

There are other examples: balloons and bounce, but these will not compile or run... yet. They
depend on features which have not yet been implemented.
